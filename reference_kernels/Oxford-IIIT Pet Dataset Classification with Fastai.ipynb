The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation. Here we will use the fastai library to train a model for multi-class classification of cat and dog breeds. Future kernels will look at bounding-box detection and image segmentation with the fastai library.\n\nThis kernel was inspired by [lesson 1](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb) of the [2019 version of fast.ai Part 1](https://course.fast.ai)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%reload_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's import all the necessary libraries.
